# Mata classes for HTML tags/attributes
Contains Mata classes for HTML tags and attributes defined at [http://www.w3schools.com/tags](http://www.w3schools.com/tags).  

# NOT FOR PRODUCTION USE
This repository is completely untested and was built using some metaprogramming/metascripting contained in makeClasses.do.  Eventually, the classes will be used to construct HTML documents with the attributes defined at the site above and will facilitate development of the [d3mata](https://github.com/wbuchanan/d3mata) library.
